This public repository contains all the projects I developed and the materials I used for my studies during my three-year bachelor's degree.
Many files and documents may not be correct, but they have been left as they are intentionally because they were important for my learning process.
I therefore ask anyone using the files and documents from this repository to use them with caution.
